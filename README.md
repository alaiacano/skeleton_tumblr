This is a tumblr theme based on the [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhgamache/Skeleton) grid boilerplate. It will hopefully be in the tumblr theme garden at some point.

The tumblr template engine documents can be found at http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes

## Files
The following files are required.

* `skeleton_theme.html` - The actual theme code. Copy/paste this into your custom HTML box in the tumblr theme customization page.
* `javascripts/lastfm.js` - For retreiving your current track from last.fm (optional). It will require a last.fm API key which you can enter as an advanced customization option on tumblr.
* `jqyery-1.5.1.min.js` - jquery
* `stylesheets/base.css`, `layout.css`, `skeleton.css` - The Skeleton
  css files. AKA all of the hard work.
